## What Is a Team?
- **Work group:** Low interdependence, information sharing.
- **Team:** High interdependence, shared planning, problem-solving, and accountability.
- Studied teams ranged from **3–50 people** (median: 9).

---

## How Effectiveness Was Measured
Effectiveness was assessed using **four combined measures**:
1. Executive evaluation
2. Team lead evaluation
3. Team member evaluation
4. Sales performance vs quota

This balanced **results, culture, and lived experience**.

---

## Key Finding
> Team effectiveness depends more on **team dynamics** than individual talent, seniority, or personality.

---

## Five Dynamics of Effective Teams (in order of importance)

### 1. Psychological Safety
Team members feel safe to:
- Ask questions
- Admit mistakes
- Offer ideas
- Take interpersonal risks

This was the **strongest predictor** of effectiveness.

### 2. Dependability
- Team members reliably deliver **high-quality work on time**.

### 3. Structure & Clarity
- Clear roles, goals, expectations, and decision-making processes.
- Often supported by frameworks like **OKRs**.

### 4. Meaning
- Individuals find personal purpose in their work.

### 5. Impact
- Team members believe their work makes a difference.

## What Did *Not* Predict Effectiveness
The following were **not statistically significant** at Google:
- Colocation
- Consensus-driven decision making
- Extroversion
- Individual performance
- Seniority or tenure
- Team size

(These may still matter in other organizations.)

---

## Psychological Safety in Practice
Defined by Amy Edmondson as:
> “A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.”

Key behaviors that improve safety:
- Frame work as learning, not execution
- Acknowledge fallibility
- Model curiosity

---

## How Teams Improve
- Teams complete surveys aligned to the five dynamics
- Results are anonymized and discussed together
- Facilitated conversations identify improvement actions

---

## Why This Matters
Teams with strong dynamics:
- Retain talent longer
- Generate better ideas
- Perform better financially
- Are rated twice as effective by executives

---

## Core Takeaway
**Healthy conflict, open communication, and psychological safety are foundational to high-performing teams.**
